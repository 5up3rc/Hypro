Hypro - VMI on BitVisor to detect hidden rootkits.

tools/adore-ng is a well-known LKM(loadable kernel modules) rootkit for getting root privilege, hiding certain processes, files, ports, .etc.
tools/hypercall has the files to read VM's processes, loaded kernel modules, physical memory from VMM, so we can check the differences to find exceptions.
core/vmmcall_test.c implements the core VMI functions.
VMI/fs is a ported EXT4 file system from Uboot. With this module, we can reread block device to check to hidden files.

BitVisor uses parapass-through architecture that allows VM's device driver to handle the real device. So VMI/fs is ported to host's OS.

How to build:
Hypro's build can be found in BitVisor's HomePage.
